# Delhivery - data analysis

## Project Title : 
Delhivery - EDA & Data cleaning . 

## Project Description : 
Delhivery is the largest & fastest growing company. They aim to build operating system for commerce, through a combination of world-class infrastucture , logistic operation of the highest quality.

Aim : 
The company wants to understand the data coming from data pipelines so for that we will clean, sanitize & manipulate the data to get the features out of raw fields.

## Link to the Dataset
Dataset - [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/173e4Q4l4pZd1BKDkNUoTXuO0cJ11XnGS/view?usp=drive_link)

## Data contains following attributes columms : 
The datase contain following columns with detials:
1. trip creation time - Timestamp of trip creation.
2. Route schedule uuid - Unique ID for a particular route schedule.
3. Route type - Transportation Type. FTL - Full Truck load : FTL shipment takes less time as truck is not making no other pickups or drop-offs along the way. Carting - Handling system consiting of small vehicles (carts).
4. trip_uuid - Unique ID given to a particular trip (A trip may include different source and destination centers).
5. source_center - Source ID of trip origin

6. source_name - Source Name of trip origin

7. destination_cente - Destination ID

8. destination_name - Destination Name

9. od_start_time - Trip start time

10. od_end_time - Trip end time

11. start_scan_to_end_scan - Time taken to deliver from source to destination

12. is_cutoff-Unknown field

13. cutoff_factor - Unknown field

14. cutoff_timestamp - Unknown field

15. actual_distance_to_destination - Distance in Kms between source and destination warehouse

16. actual_time - Actual time taken to complete the delivery (Cumulative)

17. osrm_time - An open-source routing engine time calculator which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance
through major and minor roads) and gives the time (Cumulative)

18. osrm_distance - An open-source routing engine which computes the shortest path between points in a given map (Includes usual traffic, distance through major and minor roads) (Cumulative)

19. factor-Unknown field

20. segment_actual_time - This is a segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery

21. segment_osrm_time - This is the OSRM segment time. Time taken by the subset of the package delivery
22. segment_osrm_distance - This is the OSRM distance. Distance covered by subset of the package delivery

23. segment_factor - Unknown field
